						Some homeschooling familes educate their children following a process
						known as unschooling. This style of education is also known as natural,
						organic, interest-driven, child-led, or self-directed learning. There are
						probably as many methods of unschooling as there are children in families
						who practice the unschooling life style.

						What ties the unschooling educational style together is its emphasis on
						process. The unschooling philosophy holds that learning is natural to human
						beings just as swimming is natural for fish or flying is natural for birds.
						The idea is that parent will provide an environment and the resources
						that their children need to learn, and then (figuratively) step back and 
						provide their children the freedom to learn at their own pace. John Holt,
						the father of the unschooling movement, concludes his book <i>How Children
						Learn</i> with the following passage
							 
						<blockquote>
						  &quot;Birds fly, fish swim, man thinks and learns. Therefore, we do not need
						  to motivate children into learning by wheedling, bribing or bullying. We do
						  not need to keep picking away at their minds to make sure they are learning.
						  What we need to do, and all we need to do, is bring as much of the world as
						  we can into the school and classroom (in our case, into their lives); give
						  children as much help and guidance as they ask for; listen respectfully when
						  they feel like talking; and then get out of the way. We can trust them to do
						  the rest.&quot;
					  </blockquote>
						
						<p>
							 The overall goal of unschooling is to capture your child's interest and
							 use the item your child is passionate about as an entrance into teaching
							 the student the academic skills they will need later in life. For example,
							 if your child is excited about learning to sew, you would help them learn
							 to sew. In order to sew a person need to be able to read a pattern, take
							 measurements, and determine how much material is needed, which teach the
							 academic skills of reading, science, and mathematics, respectively.
