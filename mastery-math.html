            <h1>Mastery-Based Homeschool Math Curriculum Packages</h1>
						There are two primary approaches taken to teaching mathematics. The 
						first is called the "Mastery" method. The Mastery approach is named 
						because students are taught one topic at a time until they have mastered
						the concept being studied. A student does not move on to the next concept
						until they can demonstrate mastery of the first. This is how most adults
						learned math when they were growing up, and is a relatively straight
						forward (and effective) means of teaching mathematics.

						Mastery learning is based on the idea that students muyst master a topic
						before they can proceed on. Progress is based solely on the understanding
						of the subject material.  If your child can pick up the concept of carrying
						when adding two numbers in one sitting, you allow them to demonstrate
						their mastery of the amterial and move on. Similarly, if a child requires
						more than one chance to demonstrate proficiency, you provide that. If
						your child fails to demonstrate that he can borrow in subtraction (for
						example), you would repeat the instruction (preferably by approaching
						it in a fresh way) and re-evaluate. You do not move on until the child
						can show that he/she understands the concept.
						<br />
						<br />
						Proponents claim many advantages to the Mastery approach.  Among these
						are:
						<br />
						<br />
						<ul>
								<li>
										The student earns a sense of accomplishment that arises from
										mastering a topic.
								<br />
								<br />
								</li>
								<li>
										The ease of determining the progress a student is making.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
								<li>
										Advanced students are able to progress rapidly at their own
										pace.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
								<li>
										All students can be expected to have a certain precise amount
										of knowledge of the material.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
						</ul>
						Detractors claim that using the Mastery approach has the following disadvantages:
						<br />
						<br />
						<ul>
								<li>
										Teaching students material they are not ready for can make
										learning much more difficult and much less enjoyable.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
								<li>
										Slower students can be left behind.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
						</ul>
