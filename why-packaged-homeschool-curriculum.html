            <h1>Why Use a Homeschool Curriculum Packages?</h1>

            <p class="noline">
				Homeschooling provides you the freedom to design your own curriculum. You can create a program that is
				 uniquely tailored to your family and your children, precisely because you are designing an individualized
				 education. With such latitude why do so many homeschooling parents select a homeschool curriculum package?
				 <br />
				 <br />
				 There a several advantages to purchasing a homeschool curriculum package.
			</p>
			<ol>
				 <li>
				    The work has been organized for you and broken down into daily lesson plans and assignments. You
					know what will be covered each day. This significantly reduces the amount of time that must be
					devoted to planning, allowing you to focus on the best means to teach your child.
				 </li><br/>
				 <li>
					You know the curriculum will cover all of areas that need to be learned. One of the common worries
					of homeschooling parents&mdash;especially parents who are just strating out&mdash;is that they will
					forget to cover something. Using a homeschool curriculum package will offer you the peace of mind
					that comes from knowing that all of the material that <i>needs</i> to be covered <i>will</i> be covered.
				 </li><br/>
				 <li>
					All of the materials are provided. Life is busy enough without having to schedule extra time devoted 
					to tracking down and acquiring the items that you will need for homeschooling.
				</li><br/>
				<li>
					Packaged curriculum gives a framework to follow and provide a sense of security. Taking on the
					responsibility for designing an entire curriculum can feel overwhelming, escpecially in your first
					years of homeschooling.
				</li><br/>
				<li>
					Homeschool curriculum packages will tend to be based on the standard scope and sequence. This can
					be important if you think that your children might some day return to a more traditional school.
				</li>
			</ol>
			<p>
				 The best thing about homeschool curriculum packages is that you can pick-and-choose individual subjects in
				 the package to cover areas you would like a little help in. Although designed to work together as a package, 
				 there is nothing that says you have to use everything. If you feel a bit insecure about teaching math, for
				 example,you can use the math texts and workbooks from one of the curriculum packages.
