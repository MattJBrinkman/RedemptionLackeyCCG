            <h1>Disadvantages of a Classical Education</h2>
							While there are undoubtedly many advantages in a classical approach
							to homeschool education, no method is without some drawbacks. The 
							first among these is that the trivium is designed to appeal to the 
							nature of children in general. This division can fail when the traditional 
							categories breakdown. In general children who are highly gifted can 
							end up chafing under the highly disciplined approach of a classical 
							education. For example gifted children may find the emphasis on memorization 
							during the Grammar Stage to be too rigid and limiting for your child.

							A second drawback is inherent in the idea of the cyclical education 
							(see our discussion of the Spiral approach to teaching mathematics).
							In cyclical methods facts, concepts, and subject matter are introduced 
							when they fit into the cycle. At times these elements may be thrown 
							out in what might appear to be a random manner, detracting from the 
							learning process. It is also possible that students may not be ready 
							to learn the items at the point when they are taught.
							<br />
							<br />
							A final set of possible drawbacks is related to the curriculum itself. 
							A classical education focuses on language and history and uses those 
							subjects to organize the curriculum. This emphasis on language and 
							history means that classical education has a tendency to be weak on 
							other areas such as science and mathematics. More importantly, students 
							who do not enjoy language can find the language-centered focus of 
							classical education to be quite a barrier to overcome.
