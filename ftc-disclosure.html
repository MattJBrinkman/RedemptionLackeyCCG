            <h2>FTC Disclosure</h2>
						Since the federal government apparently does not have enough things to do to keep it busy,
						the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires that websites disclose any relationship that
						we have between a product manufacturer, supplier or service provider when we write about a
						product or service.
						<br />
						<br />
						<ul>
						    <li>
								    We have not been paid for writing the reviews and recommendations on this
										web site.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
								<li>
										The opinions on this site are strictly our own and are based on personal experience
										and/or research. No publisher, supplier, or advertiser will ever influence the content
										of this web site.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
								<li>
										If the website has a link to a product or publisher, we may get paid a commission if you
										purchase the product or service.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
						</ul>
						<p>
 						    Certain pages on the HomeschoolCurriculumPackage.com website have a section of "Ads by Google." The choice of
						    advertisements in these sections are selected by Google, not by us. If any of the Google ads for a product 
						    appear on page discussing that product it will be a coincidence.
						    <br />
								<br />
								Certain pages on the HomeschoolCurriculumPackage.com website have a section titled "For Further Reading." This
								section contains books that we feel are of interest to the topic at hand. We use Amazon links for these books,
								since they allow readers to click though to see additional product descriptions, user reviews, and current prices.
								<br />
								<br />
								If you purchase products using our affiliate links, we may receive a small commission. You will be helping support
								us for the the time and expense required to write and maintain this website. If you prefer that we not receive this
								commission, you can go to the publisher's or supplier's website and purchase directly from them. The choice is yours.
								<br />
								<br />
								We appreciate your visit to HomeschoolCurriculumPackage.com. We hope that we were able to help you find information
								that is relevant to your homeschool curriculum choice. Thank you.
