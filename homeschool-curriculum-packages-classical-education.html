            <h1>Homeschool Curriculum Packages: Classical Education</h1>
							 Classical education focuses study on the framework of the trivium,
							 which consisted of the grammar, logic, and rhetoric. This three part
							 process corresponds to three stages of a child's intellectual development.

							 The "grammar" stage corresponds to the first years of a child's education-typically
							 first through fourth grade. This stage is marked by both the ability
							 and the desire to acquire factual knowledge. In the early years a
							 child's mind is like a sponge capable of absorbing a wide-range of
							 facts. This is fed in the grammar stage by memorizing spelling rules,
							 math facts, vocabulary, and historical dates, for example. These
							 facts then become the building blocks of the later stages.
							 <br />
							 <br />
							 The "logic" phase roughly corresponds to the next four school years
							 (or fifth through eighth grade). This is the point in life at which
							 the facts learned in the grammar phase are connected to each other.
							 The student is taught how to analyze the relationships between the
							 facts they have learned. Ideas take precedence over facts. During the
							 stage arithmetic is replaced by algebra, literature is critiqued
							 rather than simply read, and students learn the causes of historical
							 events.
							 <br />
							 <br />
							 The final stage, corresponding to high school, is the "rhetoric."
							 The student of rhetoric combines the analysis skills learned in the
							 logic phase with the raw facts gained during the grammar to generate
							 their own original ideas. The student is then expected to be able
							 to present their ideas with both force and elegance.
							 <br />
							 <br />
							 There are two items that help to unify each of these three stages.
							 The first is a reliance on learning Latin as a language. Proponents
							 of classical education point to the fact that Latin underpins most
							 of the Western languages-over 50% of English words can trace their
							 roots to Latin, for example.  In addition, the study of Latin provides
							 a good foundation for understanding grammar and the parts of speech
							 and how they are correctly used. Lastly, Roman ideas have shaped
							 much of Western culture, and what better way to understand the thought
							 processes of the Roman civilization than by learning their language?
							 <br />
							 <br />
							 The second unifying measure is a four-year cycle for learning.
							 Traditionally classical education uses history as a focal point. 
							 Students learn history in chronological order, with the whole of 
							 history divided into four year cycles. These cycles are presented 
							 three times (in increasing depth) over the standard twelve years 
							 of schooling. Other subjects, such as the arts, literature, and science
							 are focused around the time period which is the current historical
							 focus. This provides an organizing principle for the studies, helping
							 students assimilate the information and allowing them to make connections
							 between the subjects.
