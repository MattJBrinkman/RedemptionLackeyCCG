            <h1>Advantages of Computer-Based Education</h1>
								Computer-based curriculum packages share many of the advantages 
								of the more traditional establish curricula. Like traditional curriculum 
								packages, computer-based instruction provides all of the materials 
								necessary, ensuring that the traditional scope and sequence are 
								covered without knowledge gaps. In addition, they provide extra 
								capabilities to assess and review your children's progress.

								/* 300x250, created 8/11/10 */
									google_ad_slot = "5496156471";
									google_ad_width = 300;

								Computers excel at record keeping, and for the teacher this creates
								additional advantages. Along with automated grading, a computerized
								system is capable of producing a number of different reports. In
								addition to changing the information reported, the teacher can also
								choose a number of different formats offering different perspectives
								on a child's progress.
								<br />
								<br />
								Unlike humans, computers also do not tire of repetition, and do 
								not get offended if a carefully crafted lesson plan is ignored or 
								not needed. Computer-based curriculum packages allow students to 
								repeat lessons until they achieve mastery of the topic at hand, 
								or skip one or more lessons if mastery is already achieved (or not 
								desired).
								<br />
								<br />
								Computer-based instruction also provides a number of advantages 
								to the parents. First among these is that they can eliminate a great 
								deal of the hours required for homeschooling outside of the classroom. 
								The best packages handle not only the routine record keeping, but 
								also much of the lesson planning.
								<br />
								<br />
								Lastly, for families with more than one student, computer-based 
								curriculum can be quite economical in the long run. Most packages 
								allow multiple students to use the program at one time, but more 
								importantly, with the text and work books all on the computer, there 
								are no consumables that would require a parent to purchase a brand 
								new copy of the curriculum every year.
