            <h1>Homeschool Curriculum Packages: Traditional Education</h1>

				The traditional method of homeschooling provides text- and workbook-based
				education similar to what we probably first think of when we think of
				school. This is because as children we were taught using the traditional
				method.

				 A good traditional homeschool curriculum package will take you step by
				 step through each day. Textbooks will be used to provide instructional
				 material. Students will use workbooks and other assignment to obtain and
				 demonstrate mastery of the subject. In most cases, the teacher is able to
				 evaluate the work using a teacher's guide for the material.
				 <br />
				 <br />
				 Before	continuing, it is important to face head on a common and (in our
				 opinion) invalid criticism of traditional curriculum that is commonly heard in
				 the homeschool community. This is that schools use traditional curriculum
				 (particularly workbooks) as nothing more than busy work. It is claimed that teachers
				 use the lessons to keep children occupied while they work on administrative tasks or
				 devote more time to children who need extra help. This is then put forward as an
				 argument against using traditional curriculum at home. While no one disputes this
				 may occur in a formal classroom, this criticism has little relevance in the homeschool
				 setting. Few homeschool classrooms spend significant portions of their day merely killing time.
				 Furthermore homeschool parents do not ignore their children's education to devote more
				 time to other kids.
