            <h1>Spiral-Based Homeschool Math Curriculum Packages</h1>
						The second major mathematics teaching method is known as the "Spiral"
						approach. In this method, a student does not seek to master a concept
						when it is initially introduced. Instead the student learns how to apply
						the concept by repeatedly coming back to it ("Spiraling back") during
						review. So a student may start learning a new concept today then cover
						problems dealing with things taught yesterday and last week and last
						year and so on. The idea behind the Spiral is that multiple repeated
						light exposures to a topic helps teach the concept better than a single
						in depth period of study.

						The method is called a Spiral (rather than a circle, for example), because
						each time the student touches on a concept he will touch upon it more
						deeply, learning more about the topic. One particular facet of this 
						is that when a student studies a new concept he/she is not expected 
						to "get it" immediately. The purpose of the introduction is to let the 
						student become familiar with the topic and then understand it more fully 
						when you return to the concept in the future. 
						<br />
						<br />
						People arguing in favor of the Spiral methodology point to the following advantages:
						<br />
						<br />
						<ul>
								<li>
										Students are given an opportunity to learn the material when
										they are ready for it.  If they are not ready for it now, maybe
										they will be next week of next year when the topic is revisited.
								<br />
								<br />
								</li>
								<li>
										Continual review helps to cement ideas and concepts in place
										better than a single period of study does.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
								<li>
										The repetitive nature of the Spiral is beneficial to slower students.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
						</ul>
						Detractors of the Spiral point to:
						<br />
						<br />
						<ul>
								<li>
										Mixing a bunch of different ideas from a number of different
										areas can be confusing for a student.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
								<li>
										Measuring progress is difficult. If a student is not expected
										to "get it" right now, it is difficult for parents to see what
										they are "getting."
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
								<li>
										Students are somewhat deprived of the sense of accomplishment
										that comes from mastering a topic.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
								<li>
										The repetitive nature of the Spiral can be boring to advanced
										students.
										<br />
										<br />
								</li>
						</ul>
