            <h1>Disadvantages of Living Books</h1>
							 There are a number of disadvantages to the living books approach
							 to homeschool education. The first is that not all children share 
							 a temperament that is well suited to this approach. Maybe your child 
							 does not like to read, or maybe your child is a hands-on learner 
							 who learns best by doing activities. For those children, a living 
							 books approach is likely to be a poor fit.
							 <br />
							 <br />
							<div id="adblock">
								<script type="text/javascript"><!--
									google_ad_client = "pub-4633244651203347";
								/* 300x250, created 8/11/10 */
									google_ad_slot = "5496156471";
									google_ad_width = 300;
									google_ad_height = 250;
								//-->
								</script>

							</div>
							 A second drawback to the living books approach is that it is difficult 
							 to use it to teach various subjects. While topics in history and 
							 geography can take full advantage of the living books approach, there 
							 are very few excellent literary works on algebra or even addition. 
							 This means that this approach will require supplemental materials 
							 to cover math and science, which not only requires additional investment, 
							 but also may lead children to make false distinctions between subjects.
							 <br />
							 <br />
							 The last major drawback is that a living books approach does not 
							 follow the standard scope and sequence that cover which topics need 
							 to be covered when. This raises two possible problems... First, it 
							 is easy to get into a situation where certain types of stories are 
							 emphasized repeatedly while other areas fall by the wayside. This 
							 can lead to gaps in your child's education. Of secondary concern 
							 is that by leaving the traditional scope and sequence by the wayside, 
							 it could cause your child some adjustment should he/she ever need 
							 to move into a more formal school situation.
