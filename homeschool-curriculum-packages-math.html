							 I can hear you asking yourself, "Why is there an entire section devoted
							 to math?" That is a good question, and one that has a couple of different
							 (and hopefully good) answers.

							 First, of all the subjects that need to be taught in homeschool the
							 one that causes parents the most anxiety overall is math. When facing
							 the task of teaching math many parents start thinking negative thoughts
							 like "I don't know how to teach math. Heck, I don't even remember
							 the math I learned." I personally believe that lot of this comes
							 from our youth when we were taught the false idea that certain people
							 were "math" people and others weren't. But no matter what the cause,
							 the fact is that most homeschool parents can benefit from a dose 
							 of encouragement when it comes to teaching mathematics.
							 <br />
							 <br />
							 Second, while we all recognize how importance teaching our children
							 mathematics, in the various homeschool approaches that exist math
							 tends to end up being the odd man out. Reading, history, language
							 arts, art, and even science can all fall naturally in the framework
							 of a unit study, but finding a unit studies that teach fractions 
							 (for example) can be difficult. Similarly there are few living books
							 that have math as a central theme. In these cases we need to supplement
							 the primary course of study with a math curriculum.
							 <br />
							 <br />
							 In the following pages we describe the two major approaches to teaching
							 math (Mastery vs Spiral) and the advantages and disadvantages of 
							 each. We conclude with a set of suggestions for additional resources.
							 These resources are broken out by the two major approaches.
