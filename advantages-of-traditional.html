            <h1>Advantages of Traditional Curriculum Packages</h1>
						  Traditional homeschool curriculum packages are an excellent means of providing all of the
							materials necessary. This ensures that all of the subject areas in the traditional scope
							and sequence are covered. Packaged in a form parents are familiar with from their own
							school days, they are also excellent at alleviating unnecessary concerns.

							Since traditional curriculum packages follow the traditional scope and sequence, they allow
							for further capabilities of reviewing your children's progress. Should you see weaknesses
							in your children's mastery or gaps developing in their education you can purchase any of a
						  number of inexpensive subject-oriented workbooks such as "multiplication" or "verbs" for your
							children to work on.
							<br />
							<br />
							Traditional homeschool curriculum packages are an excellent fit for homeschool families
							where the parents have little time available for preparation and bookkeeping outside
							of the classroom. The material is broken out&mdash;usually with daily and weekly lesson
							plans&mdash;to minimize the time required outside of teaching.
							<br />
							<br />
							One of the best features of traditional homeschool curriculum packages is that they
							focus on review. Many children need continual review to keep their academic skills
							fresh. You may teach them to multiply only to discover that they can no longer subtract.
							Or, you might spend weeks on adjectives finding out only later that your children have
							forgotten what nouns are. For these children constant reminders and practice are the
							best way to learn new skills while retaining their mastery of the old.
							<br />
							<br />
							Traditional education is also a good choice for on-the-go families, particularly those
							who travel alot. You know precisely what materials need to be taken with you on your travels,
							and in many cases you can lighten the load by making mini-workbooks by photocopying the upcoming
							assignments.
							<br />
							<br />
							 Another advantage to traditional homeschooling packages is that they greatly
							 simplify the record keeping process. Following a standard educational sequence, the
							 items studied in a traditional package will typically have a one-to-one correspondance
							 with state requirements. Moreover, the existence of standard assignments (especially
							 worksheets) makes it simple to keep samples of a child's work in a way that will require
							 little to no parental explanation.
							 <br />
							 <br />  
							 Lastly, since traditional homeschool packages tend to follow a relatively standard scope
							 and sequence, they provide flexibility in the event that in the future homeschooling is
							 no longer the best fit for your family. Since your child will be learning approximately the
							 same content as other children his/her age, the problems of moving from homeschooling to
							 co-op learning or to a private/public school situation are minimized.
