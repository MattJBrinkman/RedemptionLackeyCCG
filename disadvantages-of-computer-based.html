            <h1>Disadvantages of Computer-Based Education</h1>
							 Computer-based homeschool curriculum packages (like all good things), also
					 		 have drawbacks. Primary of these is that children using these packages are
					 		 glued to the computer screen for the bulk of their day. Studies have shown
					 		 that reading from a computer monitor is harder on your eyes than reading
					 		 from a book, and watching a young child spend hours on a computer can be
					 		 slightly stressful for a parent whose background has them equate "screen
					 		 time" with "wasted time."  This use also impacts the whole family as the
					 		 computer used for homeschooling is unavailable to other family members.

								/* 300x250, created 8/11/10 */
									google_ad_slot = "5496156471";
									google_ad_width = 300;
									google_ad_height = 250;

					 		 A second drawback arises from the fact that computers-unlike people-are
					 		 not flexible. Changing the homeschool schedule from what was originally
					 		 planned can be slightly difficult. In addition unless you trust your 
					 		 child with taking a laptop away from home, it is difficult for your child
					 		 to just pick up and go when they have work left to do.
					 		 <br />
					 		 <br />
					 		 A third possible disadvantage will occur if your child does not like
					 		 the program or has difficulty relating to the teaching style used by 
					 		 the computer. Unlike a human teacher it is difficult (if not impossible)
					 		 for a computer to modify the program or their style to better match a
					 		 learner's needs.  If there is a clash between the student and the computer,
					 		 your options are limited unless you decide to abandon the curriculum 
					 		 and purchase something else.
					 		 <br />
					 		 <br />
					 		 Lastly, it is very easy to be lulled into complacency by a computer-based
					 		 homeschool curriculum package. Since the computer handles the scheduling 
					 		 and automates the grading process, this can lead to a parent becoming 
					 		 disconnected with what their children are learning and the progress they 
					 		 are making.
